                    <h2>The Issue at Face Value</h2>
                    <p>The environment is being put at stake by humanity.  Nature has offered us so much; it is the very thing we were built upon.  However, in return we have innovated technology and the industry to an extent that has had extremely detrimental effects on our planet.  An article from the New York Times highlights these rising issues, stating that, "humans are now pumping the gas into the air much faster than nature has ever done"(Gillis).  Carbon dioxide levels have gradually changed over thousand year time periods, but ever since the industrial revolution these once natrual changes have massively accelerated.</p>

                <div class="section">
                    <h2>Research/Policy Suppression</h2>
                    <p>What is most concerning most of all is that research and policies favoring the environment are being suppressed of all things.  The New York Times makes a further remark that "Instead of negotiating over climate change policies and trying to make them more market-oriented, some [people] have taken the approach of blocking them by trying to undermine the science"(Gillis).  The same suppression exists with research on environmental technology.  It goes even beyond the United States, which gives me even more concern.  An article from Nature.com indicates that "environmental scientists in Australia . . . are under increasing pressure from their employers to downplay research findings or avoid communicating them at all"(Lewis).</p>

                <div class="section">
                    <h2>The Reality</h2>
                    <p>It's baffling that people want to deny advancements towards a restored environment, but these views don't come without reason.  Installing environment friendly sources of power are often rather expensive.  Just look at electric cars and solar panels!  Now of course, efforts are being to lower the costs of these, but at a frighteningly diminished rate.  Human society cannot easily convert to environmental friendliness since we've grown so reliant on the technology that fossil fuels and other souces of power offer.  But instead of continually sticking to these technologies and outright refusing policies and research towards environmental friendliness, people should support these ideas so that they CAN become a reality.</p>
